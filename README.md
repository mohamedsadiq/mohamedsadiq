 Hello, Iâ€™m Mohamed Sadiq.

I'm a product designer who can code. I'm interested in web3, interaction Design, Prototyping, and building open-source software.

I'm currently doing some product design at [developerDAO](https://developerdao.com/) to accelerate the education and impact of a new wave of web3 builders.

Previously, I worked at Mass as a lead product designer.
