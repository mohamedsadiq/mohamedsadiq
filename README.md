I live for the 0-to-1 journey: turning messy, complex ideas into products people actually use and love. My playground is the fast-moving intersection of Web3 and AI.

A few things I've brought to life:

LightUp: An AI Chrome extension that earned a Peerlist Staff Pick and was named a Top 9 AI Tool in Data Annotation by SassHub.

DeveloperDAO FM: A community project I built for DeveloperDAO that also hit the top of Product Hunt and was featured in their newsletter, reaching an audience of 750,000 readers.

DAOs Spot: A discovery platform for DAOs, honored as Product Huntâ€™s #4 Product of the Week.

Ultimately, I'm just a person who gets a huge kick out of building tools that solve real problems and help innovative communities thrive.
